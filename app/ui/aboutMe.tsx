                            <p>
                                I&apos;m a Software Development student at Brigham Young University (BYU-Idaho), 
                                diving into the world of coding and algorithms. I&apos;ve decided to specialize 
                                in Full Stack Development, where I can build seamless, end-to-end solutions 
                                for the web. The journey ahead is exciting, and I&apos;m eager to refine my 
                                skills and create impactful projects!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Alongside my academic journey, I&apos;ve earned a professional CS50 with Python certificate.
                                This certification reflects my dedication to mastering programming and equips me with a
                                problem-solving mindset for clean,
                                efficient code.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Beyond coding, I find joy in video games and anime,
                                offering a creative balance to the logical aspects of software development.
                                Basketball, both on and off the court, provides a refreshing break from
                                the intricacies of coding.
                            </p>
